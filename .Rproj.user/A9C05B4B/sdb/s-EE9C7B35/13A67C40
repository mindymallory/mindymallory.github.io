First, even I will have a hard time remembering how to implement the workflow I described in a previous post, if it has been a few months since I started a new project where I am lead. Second, I want students I advise to have the easiest entry into R and reproducible research in R. A short, vague description won't do. \n\nSo, I created a template for a reproducible reserach project.  \n\nIt is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/) in [This Repository](https://github.com/mindymallory/research-project-template).  \nA tutorial that describes how to implement project can be found [here.](http://mindymallory.github.io/research-project-template/)  \n\n![](http://mindymallory.github.io/research-project-template/images/template.PNG)\n\n",
