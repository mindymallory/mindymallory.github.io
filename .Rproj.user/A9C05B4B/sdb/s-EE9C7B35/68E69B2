Just west of my parents' house is a\nnewly constructed wind farm impossible to miss on the horizon.\n\n# Background\n\nThe [Waverly Wind Farm](http://waverlywindfarm.com/) is built,\nmaintained, and operated by [EDP Renewables](http://www.edpr.com/). The\nproject's website says the farm will operate 95 turbines at the Waverly\nfarm producing 199 megawatts of electricity and displacing 331,349 tons\nof carbon dioxide from entering the environment.\n\n{{ more }}\n\n<!-- Its easier to resize the html than markdown-->\n<img src=\"{{site.url}}\\images\\Waverly_logo.png\" width=\"315.35px\" height=\"400px\" />\n\nImage Source: [Media Kit from Project\nWebsite](http://waverlywindfarm.com/)\n\nOf course a project of this scale is big news in my hometown and the\nsurrounding area. I am sure the construction of the farm brought a\nnoticeable economic stimulus to the small businesses in the area;\nlandowners now have an additional stream of income from their\nproperties; and parcels that host the turbines may see an increase in\nvalue as a result.\n\nMy parents know (and I probably do to) several of the landowners with\nturbines on their property. Rumor has it that the leases go for about\n$500 a month per turbine. That is $6,000 per year and seems to be in\nline with what is\n[reported](https://www.wind-watch.org/documents/five-questions-to-ask-before-signing-a-wind-energy-lease/)\nby [National Wind Watch](https://www.wind-watch.org/about.php), an\nanti-wind-energy advocacy group, and\n[reported](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/windustry/legacy_url/944/Compensation-2009-07-06.pdf?1421782808)\nby [Windustry](http://www.windustry.org/), a pro-wind-energy advocacy\ngroup.\n\nAs we were talking about the project my dad noted that it sounds like a\ngood deal but that \"I wouldn't do it on native prairie land.\" Apparently\nsome of the turbines were constructed on native prairie grass. Waverly\nis situated about 40 miles east of the [Flint\nHills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_Hills), and there is a\nconsiderable amount of undisturbed native tall-grass prairie. My dad is\nnot exactly an environmentalist, but he appreciates the value and\nscarcity of native grasslands. He has even tried to restore some land to\nnative tall-grass prairie with little luck.\n\n<img src=\"{{site.url}}\\images\\MeridianWayImage_01.jpg\" width=\"315.35px\" height=\"400px\" />\n\nPhoto from the Meridian Way wind farm in Cloud county Kansas.

[Amy\nAndo](http://ace.illinois.edu/directory/amyando) and I wrote a\n[paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/17/6484.short) published in the\n[*PNAS*](http://www.pnas.org/) in 2012 that outlined how a\nconservationist might use [Modern Portfolio\nTheory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory), which\ninforms how to pick a portfolio of stocks, to prioritize which land\nshould be protected in the face of climate change. The basic idea is\nthat future conservation benefits of any parcel of land are uncertain\nbecause the severity of climate change is unknown and it is also unknown\nhow environmental or ecosystem characteristics will respond to a\nchanging climate.\n\nHowever, if you can estimate the probability distribution, you can make\nsmart choices. By exploiting covariance (particularly negative\ncovariance) between the response of different tracts of land to climate\nchange, you can maximize you conservation benefits for a given level of\nrisk, or you can minimize your risk for a given level of conservation\nbenefits. The first paper published in *PNAS* invoked a highly stylized\nexample.\n[Work](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765514000402)\non [this](http://le.uwpress.org/content/91/4/664.refs) problem since\nthen has focused on refining the technique to the point that the method\ncould be used in practice by a conservation agency or other institution.\n\nWe have work in progress that considers how multiple objectives might be\nconsidered in the portfolio problem. There is very little work in this\narea. Since the method comes from finance this is no surprise. When\npicking stocks the expected return and its standard deviation are mostly\nall one cares about. However, in environmental, resource, and\nconservation problems, there are often multiple objectives one might\ncare about. Sometimes those objectives are complimentary, but not\nnecessarily so.\n\nConsider the wind farm described above. The wind farm produces energy\nwith a low carbon footprint and displaces energy produced by coal fired\nelectric power plants --- thus it is *good* for the environment.\nHowever, when the turbines are placed on native tall-grass prairie the\nturbine itself and the access roads disturb a considerable amount of a\nvery scarce resource.\n\nConsidering just the environmental benefits of reduced carbon dioxide\nemissions leads to the destruction of some native tall-grass prairie. If\na multiple objective approach had been used, alternative sites may have\nserved just as well and not degraded the native prairie. Of course, the\nproject is built by a private firm on land held by private citizens so\nthey would not consider the tall-grass prairie conservation objective\nunless they were compensated for or prevended from (by regulation or\nother means) doing so, or unless they by chance intrinsically valued the\ntall-grass prairie resource more than the wind farm offered in\ncompensation.\n",
