title: "Multiple Objectives in Conservation Portfolios: Waverly Wind Farm"
---


My husband, kids, and I just got back from visiting my family in Williamsburg, KS for Christmas. Impossible to miss on the horizon just west of my parents house was a newly constructed wind farm. 

The [Waverly Wind Farm](http://waverlywindfarm.com/) built, maintianed, operated by [EDP Renewables](http://www.edpr.com/). The project's website says the farm will operate 95 turbines at the Waverly farm producing 199 megawatts of electricity and displacing 331,349 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the environment.

Of course a project of this scale is big news in my hometown and the surrounding area. The construction of the farm would have been a noticable economic stimulus. Landowners now have an additional stream of income from their properties, and land containing the turbins may see an increase in value as a result. 

My parents know (and I probably do to) several of the landowners with whom EDP Renewables have entred into long term leases to locate the turbings on the landowners property.
