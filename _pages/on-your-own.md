Starting Your Own Reproducable Project
======================================

Once you understand how all the peices fit together you can modify these
files to conduct your own reproducable project. Just make sure your
`data-raw` is accessed by your analysis scripts and that your results
are stored in the `anlaysis-output` folder. Then make sure your
manuscript pulls the data and analysis results automatically.
