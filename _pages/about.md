### Research

My research focuses on agricultural marketing and policy. I analyze prices and risk in commodity, environmental, and natural resource markets to determine if they function in an efficient manner. Also, my work investigates whether risk management activities and governmental policies are effective.


### Teaching

**Microeconmic Analysis (ACE 500)**: This is standard first-year master's theory class. It has a heavy emphasis on core neoclassical economic theory, with some modern extensions.

**Commodity Price Analysis (ACE 427)**: Students learn what drives prices in commodity markets. First we cover fundamental supply and demand characteristics of key commodity markets like corn, soybeans, and wheat, livestock and energy. Considerable time is spent introducing the student to important sources of information (from the United States Department of Agriculture, e.g.) that are critical to market participants.

**Commodity Futures Markets (ACE 428)** Students gain a working knowledge of commodity futures and options markets. We cover the markets’ role as an economic allocation mechanism, describe intuitively and analytically the relationship between a commodity’s cash, forward, and futures prices, price option contracts according to some popular models, and implement a risk management strategy that includes hedging on a commodity futures exchange.
