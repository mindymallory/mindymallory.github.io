title: "Reproducible Research Project Template and Tutorial"
---

After ruminating on reproducible research project for about a semester, I realized two main obsticles. First, even I will have a hard time remembering how to implement the workflow I described in a previous post, if it has been a few months since I started a new project where I am lead. Second, I want students I advise to have the easiest entry into R and reproducible research in R. A short, vague description won't do. 

So, I created a template for a reproducible reserach project.  

It is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/) in [This Repository](https://github.com/mindymallory/research-project-template).  
A tutorial that describes how to implement project can be found [here.](http://mindymallory.github.io/research-project-template/)
