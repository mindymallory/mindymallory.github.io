title: "Lightning talk on Research"
---

My colleague, [Sandy Dall'Erba](http://ace.illinois.edu/directory/dallerba), organized a department seminar for everyone to give a 7-minute talk on thier research. I thought this was a great idea and I am eager for tomorrow to hear what everyone in ACE is working on. 

If you want to take a look at my presentation, [here you go!](https://mindymallory.github.io/About-me-7-minutes/#(1))
